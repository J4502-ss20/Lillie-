          <h4>Reporting with a language barrier</h4>
          <p>November 11, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I have been working for some weeks on a story about one family’s experience fighting for their children’s ability to participate in virtual online education. The article is set to be published sometime this week. Reporting this story came with some difficulties.</p>
          <p>Not only was this story concerning a confusing legal situation, but the mother and father of the young students were both deaf. While I would regularly just call my sources to get in touch with them and set up a time to meet, I had to use email. That was no big deal. But when I was able to meet with them in person, the language barrier made it difficult for me to (1) ask them questions and (2) understand their responses. I ended up having to rely on email quite a bit to interact with the parents.</p>
          <p>At one point, I was wondering whether the story was actually valuable enough to struggle through the language barrier. I had two options:</p>
          <p>(1) I could drop the story and take away the family’s opportunity to share their story, their experience</p>
          <p>(2) I could continue the story – no matter the difficulty – and allow the family to explain their perspective</p>
          <p>I very quickly decided that I should (and could) not let my inability to understand or another’s inability to speak my language be the reason for shying away from a story. This was a key moment for me to choose whether I was going to exercise the journalistic value of giving a voice even to the marginalized people in the public. Had I dropped the story, I would have been neglecting to do so.</p>

          <h4>Reporting on a late night deadline</h4>
          <p>November 11, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>Following up on a story I covered previously concerning the potential sale of the Hallsville city sewer system, I was asked to cover the results after the issue came to a public vote last Tuesday. The results did not come out until after 8 p.m., and I was scheduled to work (I have a job as a university writing tutor) until 9 p.m.</p>
          <p>AND the deadline for the story to be finished and edited was 10 p.m.! That was pushing it.</p>
          <p>But, I was able to do it. First, I had to call my sources ahead of time to make sure they would be willing and available to speak with me after I got off work. Fortunately, I had already been speaking with multiple potential sources for my previous story, and securing these interviews was no problem at all.</p>
          <p>Then, I had to plan and write as much of the story as possible before the voting results were to be released. Based on the general sentiment I noticed as I had tracked the matter, I was able to (successfully) predict that the vote would be for rather than against the selling of the sewer system. However, I needed to be prepared for both scenarios. I wrote a little bit of background and prepared the questions I would ask my sources.</p>
          <p>After I got off work that evening, I had to rush back to the newsroom, make the calls, finish writing the story and work through the article with an editor. I would not have been able to produce the story by deadline had I not done the preparation I did. Although it was pretty stressful to finish the story by the late-night deadline, I was able to do it, and I was very proud to have produced such a quick-turning story.</p>

          <h4>The honor of writing a life story</h4>
          <p>November 3, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I was asked this week to write a life story – basically an expanded obituary meant to celebrate a person’s life – about a musician and former director of Marching Mizzou. I was offered the story because I, too, am a musician. I understand how music has the power to connect people on such a deep emotional level.</p>
          <p>And, man, was that knowledge supported by what I learned about Alexander Pickard. Between all those I spoke with about him and those who commented about him on Facebook or his online tribute wall, I probably saw/heard over 75 stories/memories/comments about this man. And each comment further explained how deeply this man was loved in the music community in Columbia.</p>
          <p>It was clear that Dr. Pickard treated everyone with a rare genuine love that seems hard to come by today. I found myself wishing I could just have a conversation with him and know him myself. Dr. Pickard’s story spoke to a deep part of my heart, one that has been moved to emotional depths in the past through music of my own. I am truly honored to have been able to get to know this man through the process of writing a story about him.</p>

          <h4>Meeting U.S. Senators</h4>
          <p>November 3, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I was assigned the task this week to cover a speech being given by former U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill at the new State Historical Society. This was a great opportunity in itself, but I later learned that McCaskill was going to be introduced by present U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt.</p>
          <p>To be honest, I was extremely nervous as I walked into the room where people were eating fancy $50 dinners in anticipation of the speech by such prominent politicians. Should I try to talk to them after? What if they get upset with me for trying to talk to them?</p>
          <p>This was clearly not meant to be a very political event. McCaskill was invited there just to speak about how Missouri history, culture and people had impacted her throughout her life. And she even said in her speech that she did not want to make it about politics. I wanted to be respectful of the her (and Sen. Blunt). Imagining how anxious I would feel as a politician constantly poked and harassed by the press, I wouldn’t want to inflict that upon them without a good reason… which I didn’t feel I had.</p>
          <p>A fellow reporter attended the speech (not associating himself with me, but merely acting as a public spectator). He had numerous problems with McCaskill. In fact, he had told me earlier that she was his least favorite politician. He wanted to grill her about something.</p>
          <p>Even the other reporters from local TV stations pestered McCaskill and Blunt about the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. I had also planned to ask them about this if it worked out (per my editor’s request). However, I was admittedly very timid about approaching them. I ended up jumping in and recording while other TV reporters asked questions of the politicians.</p>
          <p>Perhaps I need to grow in my boldness. Perhaps I have a great deal to learn about national politics. Perhaps, if I had had greater knowledge of the two politicians and a greater confidence in any question I could ask them, I would have been less timid about approaching them.</p>
          <p>But I do think I should give some merit to my hesitance to bother them in this particular forum. McCaskill was not talking very much about politics, but explaining her own life journey – you know, personal things. I felt that making the conversation about politics would totally deny McCaskill this opportunity to just be a person. Perhaps I sympathize too much, but at least I care about the well-being of those I cover. I will need to learn a good balance between such sympathizing and digging for necessary information.</p>

          <h4>The "Go Vote" Mentality</h4>
          <p>November 1, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I have been working on and finally published an article pertaining to an issue that will come to a vote in Hallsville, a town in Boone County right outside of Columbia. The question at hand was whether the city should sell its sewer utility system to a privately-owned company.</p>
          <p>This was to be the only issue on the special ballot, but I had noticed there had been very little media coverage of the issue. Realizing the importance of Hallsville residents to have access to information that could help them make their decision, I decided it a worthy public service to pursue the story.</p>
          <p>Out of my own confusion, I first reached out the the Hallsville City Administrator for clarification. While waiting to hear from her, I decided to call a woman who had previously been both mayor and city clerk of Hallsville and is currently representing the city as a Missouri state senator.</p>
          <p>The senator expressed some concerns about the issue that had not really been voiced through media outlets yet and led me to others who had concerns about the issue and its handling.</p>
          <p>However, once I had learned about all the concerns and possible disadvantages of selling the sewer system, I knew I needed to learn more about the city’s reasons for considering the sale. I got ahold of the city administrator and made sure I thoroughly understood the process by which the city government was handling the issue.</p>
          <p>I ended up traveling to Hallsville City Hall to speak with the city administrator in person and request some government documents that would help me better understand – and thus, better explain – the city officials’ thought process.</p>
          <p>I gathered all of these considerations, organized them and wrote a story that I was not only proud of, but earned praise from my editor and multiple sources as a piece of quality public service journalism.</p>
          <p>We strategically published the story closer to the voting date – November 5 – in order to remind Hallsville residents of the important issue and – in a sort of hidden way – suggest that they actually get out to the polls and vote on the issue.</p>
          <p>I guess all I can do is hope that it gets out there for people to read and consider.</p>

          <h4>Rhineland: Traveling to a Vilalge of 130</h4>
          <p>October 27, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>This week, I travelled with a reporter from the local TV station KOMU to Rhineland, Missouri, a small town a little over an hour east of Columbia. We spent our Friday afternoon on the road, surrounded by beautiful trees with leaves having changed from green to all sorts of reds, oranges and yellows.</p>

          <p>I am actually from a small farm-town in the northwest corner of Missouri with about 124 people, so I felt right at home. Upon arriving at the village, we met with the mayor in his workplace, Rhineland Grain Inc. and traveled less than a block over to the city hall for our initial interview.</p>

          <p>In city hall, the three of us had a pleasant conversation about the village and how all of its people had come together years ago when they moved their entire town west off of the floodplain.</p>
          <p>After our friendly conversation, the mayor suggested that he gather a variety of community members and we set aside a day for our entire team of writers, videographers and photographers to meet with all of them for interviews. I am excited to continue to learn about this sweet village.</p>

          <h4>The exciting experience of collaboration</h4>
          <p>October 21, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I have been working on a number of long-form projects this week, including two requiring some collaboration with other journalists. I do not have a lot of experience with journalistic collaboration yet, but I am very excited to say the least.</p>
          <p>The idea of compiling the expertise, perspectives and abilities of multiple people to create a story has always been appealing to me. That is one of the main reasons I decided to pursue journalism in college. In high school, when I worked as editor of the school newspaper, my favorite tasks were to work with the staff writers to both plan the week’s coverage and edit their stories.</p>
          <p>One of the collaborations is with just one other reporter from the Columbia Missourian. She is on the public safety and health beat, and I am on the state government beat. Though she was considering an issue from a strictly local perspective, I came with a broader question that would apply to the entire state. I am excited to see whether our research will bear any fruit for a good story.</p>
          <p>My other collaboration involves not only photographers, videographers and reporters from the Missourian, but also reporters from the local TV station KOMU and radio station KBIA. We met for the first time to discuss our coverage plan for story, which includes both a human interest and a deeper lying issue.</p>
          <p>We discussed how we could best use our specific mediums to best showcase particular elements of the story. Although some overlapping of information will be inevitable, we established a goal to produce a wide variety of unique elements that complement one another rather than echo or mirror one another.</p>
          <p>I am looking forward to seeing where both of these projects go!</p>
        <div class="lesson">

          <h4>Finding the stories that are overlooked or missed</h4>
          <p>October 13, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>Over the past couple of weeks, I had been following and thinking about a story that had been covered by KMIZ: ABC 17 News, another media organization covering the mid-Missouri region. The story concerned the discussion in the city of Hallsville about the potential sale of the Hallsville Sewer System from the city to a private company.</p>
          <p>According to the articles, this would help alleviate the city’s large debt for the sewer. The city aldermen had voted to put to a public vote whether the city should continue investigating this option.</p>
          <p>After reading the article, I wondered (1) how selling the sewer system would be able to relieve the debt and (2) whether this would be the wisest option for the city. In the KMIZ coverage, the idea seemed to be faced with a little wariness and concern about the quick pace of the process.</p>
          <p>I wanted to know more. I wanted to understand more of the details. And if I, someone who would not be voting on this, want to know more, I imagine that citizens in Hallsville who will be voting on the issue in early November might want to know more as well.</p>
          <p>So, I started looking into the issue a little on my own. I sent an email to the Hallsville city administrator and made a phone call to a state representative (who led me to numerous other sources).</p>
          <p>The state representative told me this was an important issue and said she was worried the public didn’t know enough about it. After hearing this, I knew my suspicion and curiosity were rightly placed.</p>
          <p>I still have some more emails and calls to make this week before I can write and publish the story, but I am excited and proud that I found this story, asked important questions and continued to pursue a story that (I hope) will truly serve the public in the way that many say journalism should: to mobilize people to participate in democracy.</p>

          <h4>Phone call reporting a missing person</h4>
          <p>October 13, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I was working another general assignment shift Friday at the Columbia Missourian, sitting by the newsroom phone while I worked in order to pick up any calls. That evening, we received a call from a girl who said she was calling to report a missing person.</p>
          <p>My mind was immediately scattered, and I could barely get out the words I needed in order to ask the right questions.</p>
          <p>First, I asked the girl whether she had reported this to the police. She said she was reaching out to us in an attempt to help her roommate locate her friend. I proceeded to ask her more questions about the situation, and gave her my contact information so she could send me more details.</p>
          <p>After the call ended, I spoke with an editor in the newsroom who had seen something on Twitter about this same girl. The problem was we could not publish anything unless we knew for sure that this missing person had been reported to the police. We finally found out that it had reported, and I wrote up a quick brief about the woman and where/when she was last seen.</p>
          <p>For a small period of time, it seemed that the Missourian may have been the first place to receive the report, and I was terribly nervous. Was I doing everything I needed to in this possible emergency situation?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
          <p>Lesson learned: when I have to report on matters of emergency, all I can do is stay calm and think clearly about the appropriate steps to take.</p>

          <h4>What it's like writing about a national political matter</h4>
          <p>October 13, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>On Monday, I wrote a story about an opinion of Sen. Vicky Hartzler, a woman who represents Missouri’s fourth congressional district in Washington D.C. She is a Republican and rarely disagrees with President Donald Trump.</p>
          <p>However, she disagreed with him when the White House made a decision to withdraw troops from Syria. And so did a number of other prominent Republican leaders in D.C. I contacted multiple of these leaders from Missouri and also heard back from Sen. Roy Blunt. He, too, thought the White House had made a mistake.</p>
          <p>Since the story was released Monday night, the article received two pretty politically-charged comments. This has been my first experience receiving such comments on an article. And I thought about two things.</p>
          <p>(1) When people make political comments on my articles – perhaps with a tone of anger – it is very likely that they are not upset with me, but rather upset about some sort of underlying issue from the actual content of my story. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with me.</p>
          <p>(2) This is one of the things journalism is about: providing the public with a forum for conversation. I was proud to be able to help provide such a service to the Missourian readers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
          <p>Lesson learned: try to keep in mind the bigger picture, the reasons we actually do journalism.</p>

          <h4>Language barriers in reporting</h4>
          <p>October 7, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I am currently pursuing a story about a family who faced issues with their children enrolling in online courses not permitted by their school district. This prohibition, however, was not acceptable under state law. The case went to court, and the family won.</p>
          <p>I hope to investigate the deeper-lying issue at hand, so I still have a lot of question. I have been trying to get in contact with the family in order to ask further questions about the issue they faced.</p>
          <p>However, a unique problem has arisen:</p>
          <p>The mother and father of the children are both deaf. And I do not know sign language.</p>
          <p>The family’s lawyer told me that the couple would need an interpreter in order for us to either (1 ) communicate by phone or (2) have an in-person interview. Fortunately, two fellow reporters know sign-language and have expressed willingness to assist in the interview process.</p>
          <p>I think it is important that I continue pursuing this story despite the obstacle. It would be discriminatory for me to turn away from this story merely because of a language barrier. I am excited to be able to continue with the story and to learn how to interview people who speak a different language than me.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
          <p>Lesson learned: don’t let the language barrier throw you off and tear you away from a story.</p>

          <h4>The importance of sensitivity in reporting</h4>
          <p>October 7, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>Over the last seven weeks working at the Columbia Missourian, I have been assigned a number of stories that have required me to learn how to be sensitive to the emotional needs of my sources.</p>
          <p>Two of my stories have involved families honoring of the death of their young children. These were no doubt very difficult stories to not only hear, but to report and write as well.</p>
          <p>For both stories, I interviewed parents, siblings and friends of the young children. I handled with much care both the preparation of questions and the interview process in order to be considerate of the family’s needs and hurts.</p>
          <p>I found that the families grew to trust me rather quickly because I mentioned to them before the interview that I did not want to pressure them to open up to me if it was going to bring them pain. I encouraged them to tell me only what they felt comfortable opening up about.</p>
          <p>Whether a result of my sensitivity or the families’ hopeful intentions to tell the child’s story, all of my questions were answered openly. Throughout the entire reporting and writing process, I was very mindful of the family and how my presence, my questions and the wording in my story might impact them.</p>
          <p>I was relieved that when I sent the articles to the parents of the children, they were pleased and touched by the writing. And they were grateful that I took such care in writing their child’s story.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
          <p>Lesson learned: it is important to be human when reporting any story, but especially stories that are likely to spur emotional reactions.</p>

          <h4>Sunshine Request</h4>
          <p>September 29, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I was given the assignment a couple weeks ago in my news reporting class of making a Sunshine Request. It was interesting to learn about my rights as not only a journalist, but a citizen in general, to access public records through the Sunshine laws.</p>
          <p>In class, we discussed how we can request records and defend our rights to them if we happen to find ourselves in a situation where we are met with resistance. The combination of this class and my communications law class have brought up some interesting realizations over the last few weeks.</p>
          <p>Between the two classes, I have been learning what the government says about rights of expression and of access to information. These are things of which I will need to continue to develop a strong understanding. If I ever face problems and resistance in my reporting in the future, it will be important that I know my rights and can stand up for myself.</p>

          <h4>On or off the record?</h4>
          <p>September 29, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I was assisting another reporter with a story this week by calling and asking questions of a state government official. The official picked up. I explained why I was calling and asked if she wouldn’t mind answering some questions.</p>
          <p>The official immediately jumped to say that she would only speak to me “off-the-record” at that point in time. Throughout the entire phone call, there was only one thing that she wanted to be considered “on-the-record.”</p>
          <p>Having never dealt with such a situation, I was uncomfortable. What should I do? I usually wait until I have permission to ask questions to pose the question whether I can record the interview for accuracy (so I didn’t have my recording on). Should I even have my recording on if the source wants to be off the record? What if the source changes his or her mind?</p>
          <p>So many questions rushed to my head. In the moment, I decided it best to take very detailed notes as the official spoke. At the end of the interview, I made sure with the source that I was clear about what was on- and off-the-record. My source seemed to appreciate that gesture.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">

          <h4>To be a student and a reporter</h4>
          <p>September 23, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I am a student at the University of Missouri. I am only taking 12 credit hours this semester, but the three-credit-hour class reporting for the Missourian requires far more than three hours of work. I also work 10 hours a week as a writing tutor. And I am a student leader of a college campus ministry. And… you know… I have friends and loved ones I would like to spend some time with.</p>
          <p>I do a lot. I am not only a reporter.</p>
          <p>This semester, I have found it to be a habit for me to make my reporting class my top priority and let other classes, responsibilities, and relationships fall to the wayside. This week, my neglect of other classes really caught up to me.</p>
          <p>I did not publish very many stories this week. I practically finished one large story that will be going into print next week, and I wrote one small article. But I could not afford to do much more than that. I didn’t have the time. This is primarily because I had to spend a lot of last minute time studying for a big Communications Law exam. Memorizing 50+ court cases can be challenging!</p>
          <p>I was reminded this week that yes, I am a reporter for the Missourian right now. But that is only one of my classes. I cannot make it more of a priority than my other classes. I need to treat them more equally. I cannot forget the other parts of my life only because I am taking the reporting class.</p>

          <h4>How much to write?</h4>
          <p>September 23, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>During my general assignment shift Saturday, I covered and wrote about a large donation made to the University of Missouri to “improve business practices.”</p>
          <p>I attended the press conference where the money amount was announced and was convinced I had a story with a strong human interest. The donor seemed to have high hopes for the money.</p>
          <p>However, I had a multiple remaining questions following the speeches of the conference. I wanted to know more about these vague improvements to university business practices. Unfortunately, I was not allowed to ask more than two questions of the donor.</p>
          <p>I used my best judgement to ask good questions of the donor and the other school officials and administrators in attendance. But when I returned to the newsroom and wrote my story, I found that I was trying to incorporate quotes that didn’t quite add any sort of news value, but instead came off as a sort of advertisement or public relations statement for the donor and the university.</p>
          <p>With the help and guidance of one of the Missourian’s assistant city editors, I cut down the story to the most important, necessary information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
          <p>Lesson learned: not every story needs to be a big human interest story; sometimes a shorter story gets the news across better.</p>

          <h4>The sweet Lizzy story</h4>
          <p>September 15, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I had the privilege of reporting this week about a 5K Walk/Run in Columbia that honored Lizzy Wampler, a 10-year-old girl who died last year from a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma.</p>
          <p>To honor their daughter, Lizzy’s parents set up a Lizzy’s Walk of Faith Foundation and the 5K race to raise money for pediatric cancer research and awareness.</p>
          <p>I was surprised her parents were willing to talk with me so long about their daughter and the foundation. The hope exuded by this family was inspiring and beautiful to me. I couldn’t help but to be personally touched by Lizzy’s story and the family’s reasons for creating the foundation.</p>
          <p>While writing the article, I wondered how I could possibly write an article to do justice to the family.</p>
          <p>I was very happy to be accompanied by a Missourian photographer, Hillary Tan, as I reported. He took some beautiful pictures, and we ended up producing a story of which I am proud.</p>

          <h4>"I am not the person you are looking for."</h4>
          <p>September 15, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>In my reporting process this week, I heard this statement – or something like it – many times. After reading a press release about some additional money being given to Missouri through a State Opioid Response grant, the next step was to find out the specific actions being taken with that money.</p>
          <p>I first called the office of Senator Roy Blunt (who released the information). Then, I was led to another person in the office who told me that Blunt’s office would not have the specific information I was looking for. He said the money had been given to the Missouri Department of Mental Health to manage and determine how to use, so I went there next.</p>
          <p>I left messages and emails with DMH and was eventually able to get ahold of someone who provided a little more clarity. However, a few days of phone tag encouraged me to check elsewhere.</p>
          <p>I was finally able to speak with Rachel Winograd, the director of the SOR project, and I learned all I needed to know to answer my question.</p>
          <p>But, then I had another question: Did any of the money apply locally?</p>
          <p>Rachel Winograd told me about some implementations affecting Columbia. After many calls without response, I decided to drive to the places. Unfortunately, nobody was able to help me at the time.</p>
          <p>Instead, I had to wait until the next morning to hear back from one of the places and had to earn special permission to even call the correct person from the other place. Although I heard back from the first place, I was led to yet another person who would actually have the answers. I left a message there and never heard back.</p>
          <p>At this point, I had been working on the story for over a week. I was anxious to finish the story, but I wanted to be able to relate the story locally. My editor and I decided to continue pursuing the local angle, but include it in a separate story apart from the original.</p>

          <h4>A Juggling Act</h4>
          <p>September 9, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I worked as a general assignment reporter this past Friday. Prior to my shift, I had started working on two long-form stories on my state government beat.</p>
          <p>Frankly, it was rather slow in the newsroom for the majority of my eight-hour shift. We received very few press releases or phone calls. We checked the routine websites for local stories. I hadn’t significant story ideas because my head was whirling with the other stories I was researching/writing.</p>
          <p>Late in the morning, I was given a long-form feature article to begin working on. I did some research and sent an email to my source. At this point, I had acquired three long-form stories, and unfortunately, multitasking isn’t exactly my strong suit.</p>
          <p>When the newsroom was hit by a rush of press releases all at once that afternoon, I was assigned a couple of briefs. Because my mind was so scattered between my other stories, I had trouble focusing on the seemingly simple tasks at hand.</p>
          <p>It became evident to me that multitasking and keeping track of multiple stories at a time is a skill I will need to develop quickly as a journalist.</p>

          <p>August 29, 2019</p>

          <p>I have written two daily articles at this point: one about a large donation to an MU department and the other about a Missouri lawmaker who announced his candidacy for governor.</p>
          <p>Both stories required me to think on my toes, move quickly and trust my gut.</p>
          <p>I learned how to conduct myself and ask essential questions at a press conference. I discovered the importance of communicating with the appropriate people that you will be attending an event.</p>
          <p>I realized the necessity of reaching out to as many people as possible in order to secure maybe only two or three voices for a story. I developed my ability to write from a compelling angle.</p>

          <h4>The Longform</h4>
          <p>August 20, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>On day one of class, I nervously stepped into the newsroom. I told Professor Mark Horvit, my editor, that I wanted to jump right into my work at the Missourian. However, I had minimal ideas to offer.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, Professor Horvit had a long-form project that he was ready to assign: a roundup summary of interesting and significant laws to be implemented in Missouri on August 28.</p>
          <p>Though the project seemed big (and it was), I wouldn’t have had it any other way. After doing a TON of research and spending many hours on the article, I learned quite a lot about Missouri’s legislative process and many of the new laws.</p>
          <p>Plus, I had a lot of fun!</p>
