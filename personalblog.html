            <p>This series finds its basis from my favorite movie quote. In the movie, Stuck in Love, one of the characters - a writer - tells his developing writer son:</p>
            <div class="list">
              <p>"A writer is the sum of their experiences. Go get some."</p>
            </div>
            <p>So, essentially that is what I am trying to do: just a bunch of different things! Here, I will write and reflect on a wide variety of things.</p>
            <p>AND...there is not really a limit to these things. That would seem to defeat the entire purpose.</p>

            <p>Similar to the Copycat Series, this series is a sort of experiment. In the last 4 or so months of 2020, a lot of things have happened:</p>
            <div class="list">
              <p>(1) I have purchased a beautiful dress for my July 2020 wedding.</p>
              <p>(2) After learning about a disease I have called hashimoto's disease, I was told by my doctor to remove gluten from my diet.</p>
              <p>(3) I have gained some unwanted weight.</p>
            </div>
            <p>So... in order to make sure that dress fits just right on my wedding day, I need to work hard to adopt a healthy, gluten-free diet.</p>
            <p>But there is another issue: I barely know how to cook!</p>
            <p>My previous attempts to rely on my own cooking even resulted in lots of Macaroni and Cheese, pizza, cerea and peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches, all of which contain - you guessed it - gluten!.</p>
            <p>So...here's my attempt to teach myself how to cook healthy food without that magical gluten ingredient. We'll see how it goes!</p>

            <a href="copycat.html" target="_blank"><h3>The Copycat Series</h3></a>
            <p>In this series, I take on the challenge of writing with a wide variety of styles, voices and technuqies.</p>
            <p>First, I will choose a book to read. Then after reading it, I will attempt to write a short story or written piece of any sort that matches the style, voice, and writing techniques of the story I just read.</p>
            <p>And I will post these attempts here for you all to see. Feel free to send me your thoughts. I'd welcom that!</p>
            <P>Of course, I will not by copying the plotline of these books. I will just be analyzing the authors' techniques and trying them out on my own.</p>
            <p>Through this series, I hope to learn how to write more creatively in a wide variety of ways and determine which style best suits me.</p>
