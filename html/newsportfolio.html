          <h4>On or off the record?</h4>
          <p>September 29, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I was assisting another reporter with a story this week by calling and asking questions of a state government official. The official picked up. I explained why I was calling and asked if she wouldn’t mind answering some questions.</p>
          <p>The official immediately jumped to say that she would only speak to me “off-the-record” at that point in time. Throughout the entire phone call, there was only one thing that she wanted to be considered “on-the-record.”</p>
          <p>Having never dealt with such a situation, I was uncomfortable. What should I do? I usually wait until I have permission to ask questions to pose the question whether I can record the interview for accuracy (so I didn’t have my recording on). Should I even have my recording on if the source wants to be off the record? What if the source changes his or her mind?</p>
          <p>So many questions rushed to my head. In the moment, I decided it best to take very detailed notes as the official spoke. At the end of the interview, I made sure with the source that I was clear about what was on- and off-the-record. My source seemed to appreciate that gesture.</p>

          <h4>To be a student and a reporter</h4>
          <p>September 23, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I am a student at the University of Missouri. I am only taking 12 credit hours this semester, but the three-credit-hour class reporting for the Missourian requires far more than three hours of work. I also work 10 hours a week as a writing tutor. And I am a student leader of a college campus ministry. And… you know… I have friends and loved ones I would like to spend some time with.</p>
          <p>I do a lot. I am not only a reporter.</p>
          <p>This semester, I have found it to be a habit for me to make my reporting class my top priority and let other classes, responsibilities, and relationships fall to the wayside. This week, my neglect of other classes really caught up to me.</p>
          <p>I did not publish very many stories this week. I practically finished one large story that will be going into print next week, and I wrote one small article. But I could not afford to do much more than that. I didn’t have the time. This is primarily because I had to spend a lot of last minute time studying for a big Communications Law exam. Memorizing 50+ court cases can be challenging!</p>
          <p>I was reminded this week that yes, I am a reporter for the Missourian right now. But that is only one of my classes. I cannot make it more of a priority than my other classes. I need to treat them more equally. I cannot forget the other parts of my life only because I am taking the reporting class.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
          <p>Lesson learned: in order to be effective in anything, I have got to keep all my priorities in check.</p>

          <h4>How much to write?</h4>
          <p>September 23, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>During my general assignment shift Saturday, I covered and wrote about a large donation made to the University of Missouri to “improve business practices.”</p>
          <p>I attended the press conference where the money amount was announced and was convinced I had a story with a strong human interest. The donor seemed to have high hopes for the money.</p>
          <p>However, I had a multiple remaining questions following the speeches of the conference. I wanted to know more about these vague improvements to university business practices. Unfortunately, I was not allowed to ask more than two questions of the donor.</p>
          <p>I used my best judgement to ask good questions of the donor and the other school officials and administrators in attendance. But when I returned to the newsroom and wrote my story, I found that I was trying to incorporate quotes that didn’t quite add any sort of news value, but instead came off as a sort of advertisement or public relations statement for the donor and the university.</p>
          <p>With the help and guidance of one of the Missourian’s assistant city editors, I cut down the story to the most important, necessary information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
          <p>Lesson learned: not every story needs to be a big human interest story; sometimes a shorter story gets the news across better.</p>

          <h4>The sweet Lizzy story</h4>
          <p>September 15, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I had the privilege of reporting this week about a 5K Walk/Run in Columbia that honored Lizzy Wampler, a 10-year-old girl who died last year from a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma.</p>
          <p>To honor their daughter, Lizzy’s parents set up a Lizzy’s Walk of Faith Foundation and the 5K race to raise money for pediatric cancer research and awareness.</p>
          <p>I was surprised her parents were willing to talk with me so long about their daughter and the foundation. The hope exuded by this family was inspiring and beautiful to me. I couldn’t help but to be personally touched by Lizzy’s story and the family’s reasons for creating the foundation.</p>
          <p>While writing the article, I wondered how I could possibly write an article to do justice to the family.</p>
          <p>I was very happy to be accompanied by a Missourian photographer, Hillary Tan, as I reported. He took some beautiful pictures, and we ended up producing a story of which I am proud.</p>

          <h4>"I am not the person you are looking for."</h4>
          <p>September 15, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>In my reporting process this week, I heard this statement – or something like it – many times. After reading a press release about some additional money being given to Missouri through a State Opioid Response grant, the next step was to find out the specific actions being taken with that money.</p>
          <p>I first called the office of Senator Roy Blunt (who released the information). Then, I was led to another person in the office who told me that Blunt’s office would not have the specific information I was looking for. He said the money had been given to the Missouri Department of Mental Health to manage and determine how to use, so I went there next.</p>
          <p>I left messages and emails with DMH and was eventually able to get ahold of someone who provided a little more clarity. However, a few days of phone tag encouraged me to check elsewhere.</p>
          <p>I was finally able to speak with Rachel Winograd, the director of the SOR project, and I learned all I needed to know to answer my question.</p>
          <p>But, then I had another question: Did any of the money apply locally?</p>
          <p>Rachel Winograd told me about some implementations affecting Columbia. After many calls without response, I decided to drive to the places. Unfortunately, nobody was able to help me at the time.</p>
          <p>Instead, I had to wait until the next morning to hear back from one of the places and had to earn special permission to even call the correct person from the other place. Although I heard back from the first place, I was led to yet another person who would actually have the answers. I left a message there and never heard back.</p>
          <p>At this point, I had been working on the story for over a week. I was anxious to finish the story, but I wanted to be able to relate the story locally. My editor and I decided to continue pursuing the local angle, but include it in a separate story apart from the original.</p>

          <h4>A Juggling Act</h4>
          <p>September 9, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I worked as a general assignment reporter this past Friday. Prior to my shift, I had started working on two long-form stories on my state government beat.</p>
          <p>Frankly, it was rather slow in the newsroom for the majority of my eight-hour shift. We received very few press releases or phone calls. We checked the routine websites for local stories. I hadn’t significant story ideas because my head was whirling with the other stories I was researching/writing.</p>
          <p>Late in the morning, I was given a long-form feature article to begin working on. I did some research and sent an email to my source. At this point, I had acquired three long-form stories, and unfortunately, multitasking isn’t exactly my strong suit.</p>
          <p>When the newsroom was hit by a rush of press releases all at once that afternoon, I was assigned a couple of briefs. Because my mind was so scattered between my other stories, I had trouble focusing on the seemingly simple tasks at hand.</p>
          <p>It became evident to me that multitasking and keeping track of multiple stories at a time is a skill I will need to develop quickly as a journalist.</p>

          <h4>The Daily</h4>
          <p>August 29, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>I have written two daily articles at this point: one about a large donation to an MU department and the other about a Missouri lawmaker who announced his candidacy for governor.</p>
          <p>Both stories required me to think on my toes, move quickly and trust my gut.</p>
          <p>I learned how to conduct myself and ask essential questions at a press conference. I discovered the importance of communicating with the appropriate people that you will be attending an event.</p>
          <p>I realized the necessity of reaching out to as many people as possible in order to secure maybe only two or three voices for a story. I developed my ability to write from a compelling angle.</p>

          <h4>The Longform</h4>
          <p>August 20, 2019</p>
          <p>By Lillie Hegeman</p>
          <p>On day one of class, I nervously stepped into the newsroom. I told Professor Mark Horvit, my editor, that I wanted to jump right into my work at the Missourian. However, I had minimal ideas to offer.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, Professor Horvit had a long-form project that he was ready to assign: a roundup summary of interesting and significant laws to be implemented in Missouri on August 28.</p>
          <p>Though the project seemed big (and it was), I wouldn’t have had it any other way. After doing a TON of research and spending many hours on the article, I learned quite a lot about Missouri’s legislative process and many of the new laws.</p>
          <p>Plus, I had a lot of fun!</p>
